# BGSR (Brain Graph Super-Resolution)

BGSR (Brain Graph Super-Resolution) for a fast and accurate graph data classification code, recoded by Busra Asan. Please contact busraasan2@gmail.com for further inquiries. Thanks.

While a few image super-resolution techniques have been proposed for MRI super-resolution, graph super-resolution techniques are currently absent. To this aim, we design the ﬁrst brain graph super-resolution using functional brain data with the aim to boost neurological disorder diagnosis. Our framework learns how to generate high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) graphs without resorting to the computationally expensive image processing pipelines for connectome construction at high-resolution scales.

# Detailed proposed BGSR pipeline

This work has been published in the journal. Brain Graph Super Resolution (BGSR) is the first brain graph super resolution. The proposed method consists of three steps to build a HR graph of a testing subject by non-linearly fusing the HR graphs in the training sample.(1) The first step is a multi-kernel manifold learning to cluster similar low-resolution (LR) graphs in the training sample using the weights for a set of Gaussian kernels. (2) The second step is building the brain template of LR graphs for each cluster using an iterative diffusion process with a kernel matrix P about the similarity between ROIs. (3) The last step is identifying the most K similar training LR graphs of a test subject using the multi-kernel manifold learning with three centrality metrics (degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality). Experimental results and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that BGSR can achieve the best prediction performance, and remarkably boosted the classiﬁcation accuracy using predicted HR graphs in comparison to LR, and remarkably boosted the classiﬁcation accuracy using predicted HR graphs in comparison to LR graphs. We evaluated our proposed framework from ABIDE preprocessed dataset (http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/).

# Demo

BGSR is coded in Python 3.

In this repo, we release the BGSR source code trained and tested on a simulated heterogeneous graph data from 2 Gaussian distributions as shown in Example Results section.

**Data preparation**

We simulated random graph dataset from two Gaussian distributions using the function simulateData_LR_HR.py. The number of graphs in class 1, the number graphs in class 2, and the number of nodes (must be >20) are manually inputted by the user when starting the demo.

To train and evaluate BGSR code on other datasets, you need to provide:

• A tensor of size ((n-1) × m × m) stacking the symmetric matrices of the training subjects. n denotes the total number of subjects and m denotes the number of nodes.<br/>
• A vector of size (n-1) stacking the training labels.<br/>
• A matrix (n × (m × m)) stacking the source HR brain graph.<br/>
• Kn: the number of the most similar LR training subjects to the testing subject.<br/>
• K1: the number of neighbors for applying SIMLR on clusters.<br/>
• K2: the number of neighbors for applying SNF.<br/>


The BGSR outputs are:

• A vector of size (1 × (m × m)) vector stacking the predicted features of the testing subject.


**Train and test BGSR**

To evaluate our framework, we used leave-one-out cross validation strategy.

To test our code, you can run: BGSR_demo.py

# Example Results

If you set the number of samples (i.e., graphs) from class 1 to 25, from class 2 to 25, the size of each graph to 60 (nodes), K1 to 10 and K2 to 20, you will get the following outputs when running the demo with default parameter setting (alpha=0.5 and T=20 (number of iterations)):
